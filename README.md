# Exploring the fundamentals
This is a quick project in node.js that serves static assets via http.

## Goals
The aim of this project is actually to familiarize myself with some of the Nodejs APIs
that I haven't yet used, while refreshing my memory on running a node.js server that serves
static sites without using Express.
